## Why autolist.nvim
This question can be interpreted in two ways. Why did I create autolist, and why you should use autolist.

<dl>
	<dt>Why did I create autolist?</dt>
	<dd>It sounds simple, but all I wanted was a list continuation plugin in lua that makes lists function better. Bullets.vim works, but it is written in vimscript and is more than a thousand lines long. Needless to say, I couldn't find a suitable one, so I decided to create my own.</dd>
	<dt>Why use autolist?</dt>
	<dd>Autolist's files are relatively small, with the files complete with comments and formatting. It strives to be as minimal as possible, while implementing basic functionality of automatic lists, and implements context aware renumbering/marking of list entries, to take your mind off the formatting, and have it work in the background while you write down your thoughts.</dd>
</dl>

## Features
- Automatic list continuation
- Automatic list formatting
- List recalculation/renumbering
- Supports checkboxes
- Supports Roman Numerals
- Supports custom list markers

## Installation
This is using lazy.nvim, but you can adapt it to other package managers as well:
```lua
{
  "gaoDean/autolist.nvim",
  ft = {
    "markdown",
    "text",
    "tex",
    "plaintex",
  },
  config = function()
    local autolist = require("autolist")
    autolist.setup()
    autolist.create_mapping_hook("i", "<CR>", autolist.new)
    autolist.create_mapping_hook("i", "<Tab>", autolist.indent)
    autolist.create_mapping_hook("i", "<S-Tab>", autolist.indent, "<C-D>")
    autolist.create_mapping_hook("n", "o", autolist.new)
    autolist.create_mapping_hook("n", "O", autolist.new_before)
    autolist.create_mapping_hook("n", ">>", autolist.indent)
    autolist.create_mapping_hook("n", "<<", autolist.indent)
    autolist.create_mapping_hook("n", "<C-r>", autolist.force_recalculate)
    autolist.create_mapping_hook("n", "<leader>x", autolist.invert_entry, "")
	vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextChanged", {
		pattern = "*",
		callback = function()
			vim.cmd.normal({autolist.force_recalculate(nil, nil), bang = false})
		end
	})
  end,
},
```

## Usage
1. Type in a list marker (a list marker is just the delimiter used to start the list (`-|+|*` or `1.|2.|3.`)
2. Type in your content
3. When you're ready, press `enter`/`return` and a new list entry will be automatically created
4. If you're cursor is at the end of the line, you can indent your list with tab. When indenting, ordered lists will automatically be reset to one.
5. Similarly, dedent your list with shift-tab and your *whole line* gets dedented. When dedenting, markers will automatically be changed through context awareness, to the correct marker such that the list continues logically
6. Lastly, when you're done, pressing `enter`/`return` on an empty list entry will delete it, leaving you with a fresh new sentence.
7. You can even go back and delete a line. The list will be automatically renumbered.

```
- [x] checkboxes can be toggled with autolist.invert_entry, which is "<leader>x" if you used the default mappings

1. [x] these can also be numbered

a) [ ] or these can work too
b) [x] see?

I. Roman numerals are also supported
II. Just press enter, and autolist will do the calculations for you

MX. All the way up
MXI. to infinity
MXII. It really will continue forever
MXIII. -I think
```

- if the list type is not a checkbox, invert entry converts it from an ordered list to an unordered list (and vice versa)
- below is a copy of this list, but after inverting

## Mappings

Most of the mappings you'll create will look like this:
```lua
autolist = require("autolist")
autolist.setup()
autolist.create_mapping_hook("i", "<cr>", autolist.new)
```
It starts with the helper function, then the mode, mapping and the hook function. With the above mapping, it runs `autolist.new` **after** `<cr>` is pressed.

The `alias` argument converts the `mapping` to `alias` when passing to the function, for example in the below mapping, `<s-tab>` is captured and converted to `<c-d>` to pass to the function.
```lua
autolist.create_mapping_hook("i", "<s-tab>", autolist.indent, "<c-d>")
```

Here are all the public functions:
```lua
autolist.new() -- new list entry after current line
autolist.new_before() -- new list entry before current line
autolist.indent() -- indent the current list, replacing <tab> with indent line when it sees fit
autolist.invert_entry()	-- inverts the list entry, described above
autolist.force_recalculate() -- recalculates the list
```

## Configuration
```lua
local default_config = {
	enabled = true,
	list_cap = 50,
	colon = {
		indent_raw = true,
		indent = true,
		preferred = "-",
	},
	invert = {
		indent = false,
		toggles_checkbox = true,
		ul_marker = "-",
		ol_incrementable = "1",
		ol_delim = ".",
	},
	lists = {
		markdown = {
			"unordered",
			"digit",
			"ascii",
			"roman",
		},
		text = {
			"unordered",
			"digit",
			"ascii",
			"roman",
		},
		tex = { "latex_item" },
		plaintex = { "latex_item" },
	},
	list_patterns = {
		unordered = "[-+*]", -- - + *
		digit = "%d+[.)]", -- 1. 2. 3.
		ascii = "%a[.)]", -- a) b) c)
		roman = "%u*[.)]", -- I. II. III.
		latex_item = "\\item",
	},
	checkbox = {
		left = "%[",
		right = "%]",
		fill = "x",
	},
}
```

## Options explanation
Misc:
- `enabled`: enables/disables the plugin
- `list_cap`: when recalculating an ordered list, this is the max number of entries it will calculate.

`colon`: If a line ends in a colon
- `indent`: if autolist creates a new indented list after the current line when the current line *is a list* and ends in a colon. Emphasis on the current line *is a list*.
- `indent_raw`: if autolist creates a new list after the current line when the current line ends in a colon. Works on non-list lines as well.
- `preferred`: the preferred list marker when creating a new list. Put `1.` or `a)` for an ordered list.

`invert`: Inverts the list type (`ol -> ul`, `ul -> ol`, `[ ] -> [x]`)
- `indent`: when on the top level list, pressing invert inverts the list and indents it. Think about it.
- Dot repeat is also available for inverting in normal mode

`lists`: Configures the list behaviors
- Each key in `lists` represents a filetype. The value is a table of all the list patterns that the filetype implements.
- See how to define your custom list below
- You can see a few preloaded options in the default configuration such as "unordered" and "digit", of which the full set you can find in the `config.list_patterns`
- You must put the *file name* for the filetype, not the *file extension*. To get the "file name", it is just `:set filetype?` or `:se ft?`.

`checkbox`: Configures the options for checkboxes
- `left`: The pattern for the left checkbox delimiter.
- `right`: The pattern for the right checkbox delimiter.
- `fill`: The pattern for the checkbox fill.
- To make checkboxes look like `(-)`, make `left = "%("`, `right = "%)`, `fill = "%-"`. Search for lua patterns on how to configure the patterns.

#### Defining custom lists
In a nutshell, all you need to do is make a lua pattern match that allows autolist to find your new list marker.

[Here's](https://riptutorial.com/lua/example/20315/lua-pattern-matching) a not-bad article on lua patterns, but you can find examples for these patterns in the preloaded patterns section.

Here's how to define your custom list:
```lua
require('autolist').setup({
	lists = {
			markdown = {
				"%a[.)]", -- insert your custom lua pattern here
				"test", -- or use the test pattern defined below
			},
		},
	}
	list_patterns = {
		test = "%a[.)]", -- insert your custom lua pattern here
	}
})
```

Now your lua pattern (in this case `%a[.)]` which matches ascii lists) will be applied to markdown files.

## Frequently asked questions

Does it have a mapping for toggling a checkbox like bullets.vim has? Yes.

Does it support checkbox lists? Yes.

## Troubleshooting

Found that a plugin breaks when you use autolist? See [#43](https://github.com/gaoDean/autolist.nvim/issues/43). Basically you need to make sure that autolist loads **after** all the other plugins. If that doesn't work, feel free to create a new issue. Also, make sure that the capitalization of your mappings is correct, or autolist won't detect the other plugins (`<cr>` should be `<CR>`).
